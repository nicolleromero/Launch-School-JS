SET number1 = the first argument
SET number2 = the second argument
SET sum = the result of adding the numbers

CAST both variables to numbers

ADD numbers

PRINT sum

END


a function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
START

# Given an array of strings

SET finalString

WHILE iterator <= length of array
  ADD each string at a specific index to the finalString
  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT finalString

END


a function that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element 
START

# Given an array of integers

SET newArray

WHILE iterator <= length of array
  ADD every other integer to the newArray
  iterator = iterator + 2

PRINT newArray
